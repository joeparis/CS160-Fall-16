# Let's Try a New Approach

Form small groups of two to three at your table. Open a word processor document (either I'd suggest either Microsoft Word or Google Docs). Put the names of all your group members at the top of the document. You'll submit your assignment as a group having all worked on it together. To turn your assignment in you'll need to share a folder with me from your LBCC student account's Google Drive. Let's see how we can do that right now.

## 1.1 Bits and Their Storage

1. Download [Logisim](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1ODsqqIQg7sMHl5WV9lcXhMS0E/view?usp=sharing) and double-click it to open the program (no installation is needed). 
2. Together, let's use Logisim create the circuit shown in figure 1.3 of your book. As I toggle it's inputs high and low, what do you notice about its output?
3. Let's take a look at Questions & Exercises number one on page 25 of your textbook together. As I toggle the inputs for this circuit pay attention to its outputs. What combinations of inputs produce an output of "1"?
4. ​Using Logisim construct the circuits shown in Questions & Exercises 4a and 4b on page 26 of your textbook. Discuss what you see as you toggle the circuit's inputs high and low. Can you determine what logical functions do these circuits implement?
5. Answer Questions & Exercises 5 and 6 starting on page 26 of your textbook.
6. In your group discuss the following question: if the computer cannot use hexidecimal directly why do we use it? What is its advantage over binary or decimal notations?
7. Now, let another member of your group implement the circuits found in Chapter Review Problem number one. Determine the outputs as instructed in the question. Draw a truth table for each circuit. In your group label the output of each gate in the circuit to trace the its overall execution. 

## 1.2 Main Memory

1. In your group discuss how memory is organized inside the computer. Think of a different analogy than the one presented in Figure 1.8 of your textbook and write it out as if you were explaining the idea to someone who hadn't read the book. 
2. In your group answer Answer Questions & Exercises number two on page 29 of your textbook. Using paper draw out the memory and trace what happens as you try to interchange the values. What's the problem with the steps presented for exchanging these numbers? How could you correct it? 
3. In your group discuss and answer Chapter Review Problem number 6 on page 74 of your textbook. In your answer be sure to explain how you arrived at the conclusion you did.

## 1.3 Mass Storage

1. Answer Questions & Exercises number three on page 33 of your textbook. In your answer be sure to explain how you arrived at the conclusion you did.
2. In your group discuss and answer Chapter Review Problem number 11 on page 75 of your textbook.In your answer be sure to explain how you arrived at the conclusion you did.
