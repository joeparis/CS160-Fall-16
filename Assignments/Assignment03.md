## 1.4 Representing Information as Bit Patterns

All data inside your computer is encoded using only 1's and 0's, it's only how the computer interprets those bits that determines what they represent. Let's try an experiment to see what this means.

1. Open notepad and type in the names of all the members of your group each on their own line.  Save the file as *names.txt* on the Desktop of your computer. Note: this step must be done in Notepad, not Word and not Google Docs. We want a simple text document for the time being.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to [https://hexed.it](https://hexed.it/). This is a web-based hex editor, a special program that lets us look inside files on our computer. In the toolbar click **Open file** and choose the *names.txt* file you created. Notice the numbers that are displayed in the center portion of the web page and the text displayed on the right-hand side. 
3. Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to [www.asciitable.com/](http://www.asciitable.com/). In the ASCII table look up the characters in your text file and notice they each correspond to a numeric value. In fact, these are the values you see in the center of the page in hexed.it. 
4. What are those characters that appear between your names? Can you find them in the ASCII table? What do you think they represent?
5. hexed.it isn't just a viewer, you can actually edit files using it. Try it now. First, translate the following sentence into ASCII and write its numeric representation in your Word document: "Hello, CS160!"
6. Next, edit *names.txt* using hexed.it by entering the ASCII values you just looked up. When you are finished, use the **Export** button on the toolbar to save a copy of your edited file. Open it in notepad and describe what you see.
7. Now, open a blank Word document and, again, write the names of your group members each on their own lines. Save the document as *names.docx* on the Desktop and open it in hexed.it. Describe what you see. Why do you think this is?
8. Try opening several other files and file types. Perhaps some images or video or music files. What do you notice as you open each one? Write up your observations in the document you will be submitting for grading.
